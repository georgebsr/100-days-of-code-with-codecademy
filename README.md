# 100 Days of Code - My Attempts

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code repository! Here I document my journey through the coding challenge. Each folder represents an attempt, containing the projects I worked on during that attempt, along with the README documentation detailing what I did each day.

## Folders

- **Each folder** contains the projects I completed during that particular attempt.
- The README in each folder explains in detail what I worked on each day.

I've currently paused the challenge as I've transitioned into a QA Tester role. I plan to resume it in the future when the time is right.
